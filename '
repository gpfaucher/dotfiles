# TODO

- [ ] Organise repository:
  - [ ] Add a new `hosts` folder with configurations possible for multiple hosts. Add a local file per host with hardware settings.
  - [ ] Add a new `modules` folder with configurations that can be shared between hosts, e.g. services and system-wide settings and home-manager configuratios..
- [ ] Configure Neovim
  - [ ] Consider separating the configuration into a separate flake and using it here.
  - [ ]
